# Overview of Software Development

Software development covers a spectrum, depending on the desired distribution of the software.
On the simpler side is a one-off simple tool created to do a job for one person, that will never be used again...throw-away code.
On the other extreme is a full software project involving licensing, development environment standards, versioning,
documentation, distribution, support, maintenance, etc.
This documentation will not delve into all aspects of the latter case; however, many aspects of any software project are covered in
["Producing Open Source Software - How to Run a Successful Free Software Project"](http://producingoss.com).

This documentation focuses on technical aspects that can be found in any major software project,
in particular topics relevant to the Open Water Foundation and development of software for water resources:

* Software developer environment
* Software developer tasks

These topics will vary greatly depending on the chosen programming language and target operating system and computer devices.
However, many concepts are the same or similar and are covered in this documentation.
