# Development Environment Tools / IDE

An integrated developer environment (IDE) is a graphical user interface that provides features to:

* edit code, including code-completion tools
* check language syntax, indicating unused variables and code blocks, etc.
* compile software, if the language requires compiling
* if necessary, provide additional tools such as web server for running web server applications
* run the software
* run automated tests
* debug software
* interface with version control system
* build installers for deployment
* manage files in a "project"

A software developer must invest time to learn the features of an IDE.
However, once an understanding is gained, an IDE can increase the efficiency and insight of a software developer.

IDEs are often specific to a programming language.
However, some IDEs, such as [Eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software)) and
[NetBeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBeans) provide support for multiple languages.

The decision of which IDE to use is made by weighing the needs and preferences of software developers and the need for consistency.
