# Development Environment Tools / Difference Tool #

It is very useful to be able to compare different versions of single files and folders of files,
for example to understand how code has changed over time and between developers.

A useful tool is [KDiff3](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/), which provides advanced comparison features in a graphical user interface.

## Difference Tool Use in Version Control ##

Need to describe how difference tools work with Git, including binary files like Word documents.
