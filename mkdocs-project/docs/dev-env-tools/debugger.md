# Software Development Environment Tools / Debugger

A debugger is a software tool that allows the software developer to place breakpoints in software code and observe the program's memory.
For example, a breakpoint can be set before code that is known to have a bug, and then variable values can be watched as the program
is stepped through line by line.

An [IDE](../dev-env-tools/ide/) typically provides debugger features.

Debuggers can be useful but can be tedious and inefficient to use.
Software developers should weigh the benefits of a debugger over simpler approaches such as using [logging](../dev-env-tools/logging/).
