# Development Environment Tools / Logging #

Logging is software feature that may be built into a programming language or is provided as an add-on library.
Logging allows warning, status, debug, and information messages (and perhaps others) to be generated in software and output to controlled locations.
For example, messages can be output to the terminal window and/or a log file.

Logging is a mechanism to help developers monitor software processing progress and troubleshoot problems.
Logging is typically configurable by software module/package so that specific components can be observed in more detail when needed.
Configuration may occur via a configuration file, command line parameters or user interface.

Logging is useful for debugging software in a deployed system, whereas a debugger may only be available in the developer environment.

Logging features are discussed in more detail for each language.
