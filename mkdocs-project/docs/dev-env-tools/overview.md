# Software Development Tools Overview

Software development tools are the tools of the trade for software developers,
and will vary depending on the programming language and target operating system:

* Operating System - Windows, Linux, Cygwin, Mac OS X, virtual machines, etc. that provides core computer platform
* Compiler - software that converts source code into executable programs (only needed for some languages)
* Text Editor - software that edits text files such as code and configuration files
* Interactive Developer Environment (IDE) - software that provides an integrated graphical user interface for software development
* Runtime Environment - a runtime environment ("virtual machine" or interpreter that runs the software in the operating system),
used by some languages like Java and .NET
* Revision control - tools that track changes in files to facilitate finding bugs and versioning software
* Debugger - software that helps inspect running programs for variable contents, etc.
* Documentation - standards and software that creates developer documentation
* Logging Framework - software that manages messages generated in the target software, useful for troubleshooting
* Test Framework - software that allows the target software to be tested
* Installer - packaging the software for installation on the target operating system

Some of the tools (such as compiler) are only used during software development and others
(such as operating system and installer) reach back into the operating system
and must be considered during developer environment setup and deployment of the software.
